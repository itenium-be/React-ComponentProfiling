projectMonths
-------------

First Commit:
Wait as long as possible to build the feature.
Try not to depend on rerendering when a filter of another month changes

Open 2nd: 130ms
Open 3rd: 154ms
Open 7th: 120ms


With 30ms the ConsultantCountFooter is taking a long time again ðŸ˜€


Second Commit:
createSelector to cache the badge totals --> no rerender of badges anymore
createSelector to cache the projectMonths --> no rerender of the opened lists

Open 1st -> xth: 100-200ms


Third Commit:
Need to fix original functionality
--> text filters / switch validated
--> the top toolbar visibility


Fourth Commit:
The badges can be Memo'd?
Open lists maybe too?
--> to prevent rerender on route change!!


Now:
OpenedProjectMonthList
InvoiceEmail
ButtonComponent




Tooltips of Icons etc don't work --> remove the html?
